A Text-Based Roguelike in Python, based on XCOM: Enemy Unknown


**How to play:**


On your turn, a list of takeable actions will be shown. Enter the number of the action you wish to take. It's that simple.
As you kill more aliens, you can level up your soldier, gaining loot and bonus stats, to help you kill more aliens faster.


**Next steps:**


More aliens, more weapons, upgrades, 'shops'!
